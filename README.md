# Daverosan app
I developed this web application during my summer break internship to help the company organize and manage their workflow. The app centralizes clients, requests, offers, orders, and production notes, making it easier to track and update records.

Key features include:
  - Advanced filters for searching and sorting data
  - PDF/Excel export tools for reports
  - Intuitive UI for handling large datasets efficiently
